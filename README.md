# Hello-World
This is the "Hello World" repository for Triston Riddle. This repository contains some random and interesting (probably not) information, files, stuff that I felt the need to share! I hope the viewer enjoys this little slice of mind pie!


It has been a day or two since I began learning GitHub + Git! I've learned a lot from the guide, as well as a video on the subject matter. 

Thank you for reading
